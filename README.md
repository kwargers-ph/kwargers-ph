Hey! We're Kwargers, an amateur puzzlehunting duo consisting of Isaac (Aziz) and Ryon (Shiny).

This is a space where we log our thought process when solving puzzles in puzzlehunts and other miscellaneous events!

Each repository is dedicated to one event, where we'll provide a link to our team's Google Sheets and various notes on individual puzzles, as well as our thoughts on the hunt as a whole!

Unfortunately, this idea came to us after Huntinality 2021, so a lot of our thoughts on past events have long been forgotten.
